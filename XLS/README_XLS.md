#Data Availability Statement

The dataset consists of 50,000 anonymised, non-identifiable and randomly-drawn
tax units from the 2017-2018 taxpayer population in Greece.

These were provided by the Independent Authority of Public Revenue in
collaboration with the Greek Ministry of Finance in October 2018.

The data were drawn and anonymised at source, to ensure confidentiality.

However, the anonymised data are still considered confidential and cannot be
shared publicly.

**Access to the data** for replication purposes or use in future projects can be
granted in a safe computer at either the Paris School of Economics or the Hertie
School, Berlin upon reasonable request. Access can also be possible at times in
Greece, Cyprus and the UK, subject to the author's presence.

In general, I am happy to consider replication requests and I will do my best to
accomodate colleagues or work on additional projects using the data. If you are
interested in accessing the data, simply write to me.
